Additions:
- Added Pickup 2, Idol Swap, Ferrets, Combination Lock, Ouija Board, Norm, Scrapbook, Landfill, Joker Potion, and Zucchini
- Added 10 new challenges! 

Changes:
- Coral Reef, Honeypot, and Fire Eater have all been nerfed by 1 mult each, they're still strong but I'm hoping this change makes them fun while not being able to stand on their own fully for too long
- Mayhem joker has been buffed to +7 mult from +5, for a number of tiny reasons
- Stained Glass has been buffed to give the created glass cards an Edition as well
- Shrimps now gives the $3 from the joker it destroys if it successfully destroys a joker, since previously it was pretty misleading about how much money it actually gave
- Éalú gains 30 chips instead of 35
- Pinhead gives 40 chips instead of 35
- 50-ball is now Uncommon
- Fixed Recycling Bin not giving multiple instances of money when multiple cards are added at a time (for example from Familiar)
- Fixed Crazy 8s incorrectly checking for other wild cards before deciding which card to make wild
- Minor description tweaks for a few jokers, including The Fountain and Shaman
