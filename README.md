A Balatro mod I've been working on for a little over a month! Contains 50 unique Jokers, and 5 new Decks, fully complete with custom art.
Greener Jokers is designed with a Vanilla+ mindset, meaning there are no new mechanics such as Enhancements or Seals, so it should be able to fit cleanly into any other assortment of mods you're playing with! If there are any issues, reach out to me on Discord @abuffzucchini
